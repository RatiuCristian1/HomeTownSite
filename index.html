                    <p class="hero-text1">Hanover's magnificent royal gardens, Herrenhausen Gardens (Herrenhäuser Gärten), is really a number of great attractions in one. It encompasses both the Welfengarten and Georgengarten, two beautiful English-style parks; and the Berggarten, a botanic garden featuring orchid, palm, and cactus houses.</p>

                    <p class="para">Hanover's lovely marketplace, the Marktplatz, is located in the center of the historic Old Town (Altstadt), and is a great place to explore once you've seen Herrenhausen Gardens. It's here you'll find many of the city's most important buildings. One of the most notable of these lovely structures is the 15th-century Late Gothic Old Town Hall (Altes Rathaus). This attractive old building is home to a number of interesting small shops and galleries, and is where you'll find the graceful Neo-Gothic Market Fountain, built in 1881.</p>

                    <p class="para">In Hanover's Trammplatz stands the majestic New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus). Built between 1901-13 in the style of the Wilhelmine period, this palace-like structure is sometimes also referred to as the New City Hall. It's one of Hanover's most interesting structures as it's built entirely on a foundation of 6,026 beech piles and crowned with a domed tower, which stands almost 98 meters high and dominates the city's skyline.</p>
